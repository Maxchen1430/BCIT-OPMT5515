# BCIT OPMT5515 - Quantitative Methods for Managers
This repository includes the Project Files (two Excel files), Data Set, and Final Export of the report in HTML for the Final Project for BCIT's OPMT 5515 - Quantitative Methods for Managers.

## Project Summary
This analysis features the satisfaction survey of BC students, parents, and teachers/faculty members in 2012-2013. The survey includes questions, such as "Do you like school?", "Bullied, teased or picked on at school?", "Students get physical exercise?", etc., and categorical answers, like "No Time," "Few Times," "Sometimes," and "Many." In addition, further information of the survey respondents is also attached, such as "School Age (3/4, 7, 10 or 12)", "Parents (Elementary or Secondary)", and "District (Vancouver, Burnaby or Richmond)". 

## Methodology
Thanks to the breadth and depth of the survey, this data analysis incorporates both qualitative and quantitative elements, although leaning more so on the latter. The focus of this report is on exploring the correlation between different data entries using the **r value from regression analysis** to assess the strength of possible relationships. However, due to the opposing nature of some of the comparisons, some answers would feature **reversed responses within that category** as the X/Y values to formulate a proper correlation analysis; if such method is used, it will be indicated in the written results. 

Different visualizations were used, like bar and pie charts, to better illustrate the analytical results. Additional quantitative methods and components, like sampling variations, linear regression analysis, and column/scatter plot, were utilized in the compilation and presentation of this data analysis project.
